**Describe the problem while editing a pattern**
A clear and concise description of what you were trying to do and what was the result.

**Paste screenshots**
Screenshots help. But you can't post your pattern & measurement files to github. So.....

**You may be asked to post the problem to the support forum at https://forum.seamly.net where you can upload your pattern & measurement and get expert Seamly & patternmaking support.**

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
